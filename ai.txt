AI Usage

This project utilized Large Language Models, mostly Gemini, for the development.
The AI was used in the following parts:

1. Code Generation:
   - Generating initial skeleton codes for React components, specifically for the Promotions,
    Transactions, and Redemption pages.
   - Extending and modifying backend codes from A2 to make frontend side API calls effective.
   - Creating database seed scripts
   - Generating CSS to improve pages formatting

2. Debugging and Refactoring:
   - Assisting runtime errors like import/export mismatches and Prisma validation errors.
   - Refactoring code to follow practices

3. Documentation:
   - Formatting the INSTALL instructions to meet project requirements.
   - Writing README.md based on INSTALL document.

All AI generated codes was reviewed, tested, and modified by me so it fits the project
requirements and operates correctly within the specific required architecture.
