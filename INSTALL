1. Prerequisites
    The following software is required to run the project locally:

    Node.js (v18+): JavaScript runtime environment.

    npm: Package manager (comes with Node.js).

    Git: Version control system.

    Prisma CLI: Install globally: npm install -g prisma

2. Local Setup (Development)
    The application consists of separate backend/ and frontend/ directories.
    - Installation 
        # Clone the repository
        git clone [https://github.com/juhwansonn/ScoreCart] 
        cd 

        # Install Backend Dependencies
        cd backend
        npm install

        # Install Frontend Dependencies
        cd ../frontend
        npm install
        cd ..

    - Environment Configuration
        Create a .env file in the backend/ directory:
        # .env in backend/
            PORT=8000
            JWT_SECRET="YOUR_LONG_SECRET_KEY"
            FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:3000"

    - Database Setup & Seeding
        The project uses Prisma (SQLite locally). This step sets up the database and populates it with required demo data (users, transactions, events) to test pagination and roles

        cd backend
        # 1. Run migrations to create schema
        npx prisma migrate dev --name init
        # 2. Run seed script (name may vary, e.g. prisma/seed.js)
        npx prisma db seed
    
    - Run Application
        Start the backend and frontend in separate terminal windows.

        # Terminal 1: Start Backend API
        cd backend
        npm start  # Runs on http://localhost:8000

        # Terminal 2: Start Frontend App
        cd frontend
        npm start  # Runs on http://localhost:3000

3. Deployment Notes
    - Deployment Steps:
        To deploy the project to Railway:

        Point your Railway service to the root of your GitHub repository.

        Configure two separate services within the project: one for the backend/ directory and one for the frontend/ directory.

        Railway will handle the build process for the frontend by running the standard npm run build command.
